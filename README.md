# About

**Simple webapplication based on Aurelia and readium-cfi-js to select CFI information**


## Getting started

Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment *>=6.0* with NPM 3 or Yarn.
And install the Aurelia CLI

```shell
npm install aurelia-cli -g
```

From the project folder, execute the following commands:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to
build and bundle the app. There is no need to install Webpack globally. 

To run the app execute the following command:

```shell
au run
```

### Running with Hot Module Reload

If you wish to try out the Hot Module Reload, you may run your application with the following command:

```shell
au run --watch
```
